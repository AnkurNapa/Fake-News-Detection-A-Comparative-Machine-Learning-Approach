# Fake-News-Detection-A-Comparative-Machine-Learning-Approach

This repository contains the work and findings of a comprehensive study aimed at improving prediction accuracy in fake news detection using various machine learning methodologies. The project encompasses the use of traditional machine learning models as well as advanced deep learning and NLP techniques.

Project Overview
In the current digital age, the rapid dissemination of information, including false narratives, poses significant challenges. Fake news can influence public opinion, political landscapes, and even societal stability. This project delves into the complex task of distinguishing false information, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy by comparing various machine learning approaches.

Repository Contents
EDA + XGboost.ipynb: This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of our news dataset, visualizing key aspects that differentiate fake news from genuine articles. It also includes the implementation and evaluation of a machine learning model using XGBoost for fake news detection.

GPT-2.ipynb: Here, we explore the use of the transformer-based model GPT-2 for sequence classification in the context of fake news detection. The notebook covers data preparation, model training, and evaluation, accompanied by a detailed performance analysis.

Key Findings
Our investigation highlights the effectiveness of various machine learning strategies in identifying fake news. The analysis underscores the dominance of certain models, particularly transformer-based approaches like GPT-2, especially when working with limited datasets.

In contrast, more traditional machine learning models, such as XGBoost, also showed promising results, indicating their utility in scenarios where computational resources are limited, or interpretability is crucial.
